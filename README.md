# rVshare-file-sharing-API-nodejs

This is  a file sharing api using node Js  
techstack: Node Js, Express Js and Mongo DB. <br>
For file upload  in Node Js. we used a package called Multer.<br>
used nodemailer to send emails using free SMTP from our node server.<br>
create a scheduler  script on the server so we could delete 24 hours old files from the storage.
